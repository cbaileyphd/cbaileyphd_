<p><img src="/img/cbailey headshot.jpg"  width="400" height="400"></p>

<p><strong><em>Chris Bailey</em></strong> is a Clinical Assistant Professor in the Kinesiology, Health Promotion, and Recreation Department at the University of North Texas. He is a Certified Strength and Conditioning Specialist (CSCS) and a Registered Strength and Conditioning Coach (RSCC) through the National Strength and Conditioning Association (NSCA).</p>

<p>At UNT, Chris teaches courses in athlete monitoring, biomechanics, quantitative analysis, quantitative procedures, strength and conditioning, and exercise test and prescription.</p>

<p>Chris previously worked for 4 years as an Assistant Professor in Exercise Science and the Strength and Conditioning Graduate Program Coordinator at LaGrange College (2014-2018).</p>

<p>Chris completed his PhD in Sport Physiology and Performance at East Tennessee State University (ETSU) where he served as the baseball strength and conditioning coach and sport scientist (2011-2014).</p>

<p>Prior to his time at ETSU he worked as a minor league strength and conditioning coach in the San Diego Padres baseball organization for two years (2010 season with the Eugene Emeralds and 2011 season with the Texas League Champion, San Antonio Missions). He has also worked in private sports performance training with clients ranging from college prep athletes to professional football players.</p>

<p>He is active in the NSCA, previously serving as the NSCA Georgia and Tennessee State Directors, a member of the Southeast Regional NSCA Advisory Board and chair of the NSCS Baseball Special Interest Group (SIG).</p>

<p>His research focuses on athlete monitoring and performance analytics, applied strength and conditioning, sport biomechanics, and bilateral strength asymmetry. He has published and has presented on the previously mentioned topics at the national and international levels.</p>
